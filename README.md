# Omarchy for Fedora Asahi Remix
## This installation script is under construction, not ready to be used

Turn a fresh Fedora Asahi Remix 42 installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system based on Hyprland by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omarchy for Fedora (adapted from the original Arch Linux version). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omarchy is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best, now optimized for Fedora Asahi Remix on Apple Silicon.
